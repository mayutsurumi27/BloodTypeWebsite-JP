Welcome to BloodTypeWebsite-JP ðŸŽ‰

This is my very first website project, created as a step into learning web development. The goal of this project is to practice building a simple, functional, and visually clear website while exploring how to structure code, design layouts, and connect different parts of a site together.

Iâ€™m still learning, so any feedback, suggestions, or guidance from the community is greatly appreciated.
